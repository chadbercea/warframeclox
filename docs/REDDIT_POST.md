# I built a Cetus cycle tracker that doesn't look like it was designed in 2003

Hey Tenno,

I've been a Warframe player for years and got tired of alt-tabbing to check if it was night on the Plains. Every existing tracker I found... worked, but let's just say they didn't exactly capture the aesthetic we all love about this game.

So I built my own: **[Warframe Clocx](https://www.warframeclocx.com)** — a Cetus day/night tracker with an Orokin-inspired UI.

**What it does:**
- Real-time countdown to the next cycle transition
- Optional browser notifications (5-min warning + at transition)
- Works offline once loaded (it's a PWA, install it on your phone)
- 3D rotating Earth in the background because why not

**What I'm proud of:**
- The UI actually feels like it belongs in the Warframe universe — gold flourishes, void energy effects, colors that shift between warm amber (day) and deep indigo (night)
- Sound design that doesn't make you immediately mute it
- It's accurate indefinitely once synced — the cycle is deterministic math, not constant API polling

I want to be clear: **I'm not affiliated with Digital Extremes.** This is purely a passion project from someone who loves this game and wanted to make something that respects the visual care DE puts into their world.

Would love feedback from fellow Tenno. What other features would be useful? If this resonates with the community, Fortuna is next on my list.

See you in the Void.
